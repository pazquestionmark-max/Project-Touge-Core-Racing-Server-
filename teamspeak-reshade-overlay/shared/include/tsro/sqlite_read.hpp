// Deliberately minimal and deliberately read-only: it opens the file, never writes, never takes
// a lock and never runs SQL. It understands table b-trees, overflow pages and the write-ahead
// log, because a running TeamSpeak keeps recent changes in the -wal file and a reader that
// ignored it would report a stale list. Anything it does not understand is reported as an error
// rather than guessed at.
